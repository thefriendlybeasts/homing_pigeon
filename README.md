# Homing Pigeon
Homing Pigeon helps you set up homepage redirects for **multilingual Statamic sites**. It is a plugin version of the **automatic redirect** step described in [Katring Kerber's Building A Multilingual Site With Statamic](http://katrinkerber.com/notes/building-a-multilingual-site-with-statamic) tutorial. Using a plugin allows you to leave PHP in templates disabled.
